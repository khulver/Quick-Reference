# Learning to Program Syllabus
Revised: 2/19/2022

## Overview
- Learn to Program from 1 to 4 programming languages
  a) shell (not really a programming language but it can be programmed)
  b) awk
  c) Python
  d) Apple Swift 
      - write an app for the iPhone - very advanced
      - Must use a Macintosh and either an iPhone or an iPad
- This is best done using a Macintosh

1. Create a GitHub account and put this syllabus on it
   - go to https://github.com and create an account
   - create a repository called Quick-Reference
     - create a README.md file
     - create a syllabus file and put this document in it

2. Unix shell commands
  a) basic commands (some are listed below, but make a quick reference called unix-quick-reference
     general format: <command> <one or more arguments>
     ls
     ls -l
     ls -a
     ls -la
     cat
     more
     head
     tail
     pwd
     cd
     mkdir <directory name>
     touch <file name>
     how to use pipes
     man
     grep
  b) editors - there are different types of editors
     vi and vim
     sed
     boop (JSON editor)
     IDE - Interactive Development Environment (we are not going to cover this unless we learn Apple Swift)
  c) writing shell scripts 
  d) Use crontab to schedule your shell scripts

3) security
   a) usernames and passwords
   b) keys (public and private key sets)
      - keys are *much* better security than username and password
   c) multifactor authentication
      - something you know (eg a password)
      - something you have (eg a mobile phone)
  d) How to securely store you passwords in an encrypted volume

4) awk programming language

5) Introduction to git and GitHub
  - This is just very introductory information
  - git and GitHub are very popular so it is useful to at least be aware of this
  - Putting your awk scripts on GitHub
  - getting someone else's awk scripts from GitHub

6) Python programming
  - two types of techniques
    - regular programming (we will cover this)
    - object-oriented programming (we are not going to cover this)

7) Swift programming language
   - Use this to write an app for the iPhone (very advanced)
